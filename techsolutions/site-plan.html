      <h3>Protecting people and institutions against online thieves and hackers.</h3>
      <p>
         Technology is a big part of our world today in this century and technology has come very far with lots of improvement and design. Technology is very important and significant as well as needful which makes life easier for humans. It advances every single time and also comes with loop holes.
         Bad people and hackers may get to learn the loop hole of that technology and may want to use this advantage to break into people’s privacy and temper with their private activities. With this real-world problem at hand, this site is intended to tell the world about this company’s ability to solve this problem.
          We are working closely with tech giants such as google, apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram. To protect individuals from theft, our company has created a face verification method that verifies the person’s face before using the apps listed above. The apps will now be able to scan the user’s face before it proceeds to open. If the app recognizes the user’s face, the app opens; if not the app doesn’t open and it sends notification to the original user about attempted entries from a different person. 
          This face verification doesn’t only apply to social media apps. It applies to online storage such as iCloud on apple devices and google emails. You have to use face verification to access those stuffs now. Another way of protecting people from hackers and thieves is the company has created a three-step verification process. The user will be required to enter a three-step information for the device to know that it’s dealing with the actual user and no one else. These three step verifications may be simple questions the user has to input for the device to recognize him or her. 
          These questions may be as simple as the user’s favorite soccer team, the name of the user’s pet or a particular favorite pet and finally the user’s best day. If all these inputs match with then the user can have access to his or her private documents or files and if those inputs doesn’t match those private files will not be opened to the one attempting.
           This is one way to protect users from online thieves and hackers as well as scammers.

      <h3>Creating an impenetrable and effective firewall.</h3>
      <p>
        Another way the company has brought to protect users from bad people is the company has created a firewall which is very effective and impenetrable to breach.
         Security is very important in these days. This firewall will protect users against outside cyber attackers by shielding the computer and network from malicious and unnecessary network traffic. This firewall can also prevent a malicious software from accessing a computer or network via the internet.
          This firewall can also warn the user about the risk of connecting to a public free WIFI connection. This firewall will also block unsolicited and unwanted incoming network traffic. A firewall validates access by assessing this incoming traffic for anything malicious like hackers and malware that could infect your computer. 
          So therefore, this is the sole aim of the company. Which is to protect users from bad people also roaming on the internet. This is our top priority and we invite individuals, companies, banks and government institutions come to William Technology Solutions. 
          Do you want to enjoy a safe browsing in the internet, then should not hesitate to visit our website because we provide quality service and protection.
